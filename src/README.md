# Football League CLI Program

This Rust project is a CLI program that simulates a football league where six teams play against each other. The program calculates the champion based on a point system (3 points for a win, 1 for a draw, and 0 for a loss).

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

- TBD

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to consolidate my learnings in Rust up to Chapter 12 of "The Rust Programming Language" book ([link to the book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/)). Through this project, I aim to practice concepts like enums, structs, modules, HashMaps, and testing in Rust.

## Running the Program

To run the program, ensure you have Rust installed. Navigate to the project directory and run:
